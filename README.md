# 🧠 Text Classification: Traditional ML vs BERT

This project compares the performance of traditional machine learning models and a transformer-based BERT model on a binary text classification task using the **20 Newsgroups** dataset (specifically the *rec.sport.hockey* and *sci.space* categories).

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The goal is to classify news articles into one of two categories based on their textual content.

## ✅ Key Steps

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Loaded 20 Newsgroups dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
   - Filtered two categories: `rec.sport.hockey` and `sci.space`.

2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**
   - Converted text data into numerical format using `TfidfVectorizer` with a 5,000-word vocabulary.

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained and evaluated four classical models:
     - Naïve Bayes
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Random Forest
   - Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

4. **BERT Fine-tuning**
   - Used `bert-base-uncased` from HuggingFace.
   - Tokenized and encoded text data using a custom PyTorch `Dataset` class.
   - Fine-tuned for 0.5 epochs using HuggingFace's `Trainer`.

5. **Result Compilation**
   - Compiled all model scores into a pandas DataFrame for comparison.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Extend to multi-class classification
- Integrate more transformer models (e.g., RoBERTa, DistilBERT)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning & cross-validation
- Add error analysis & misclassification visualization

## 📌 Summary

This project demonstrates how transformer-based models like **BERT** outperform classical models in terms of accuracy for text classification. However, **SVM** achieved the highest precision, recall, and F1-score among traditional models — proving to be a strong, lightweight alternative.
